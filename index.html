        <h2>Re-introduction</h2>
          <p>I am taking action to undergo a career transition. Currently I'm working as IT project support for a public sector organisation in London and am in the process of transitioning to Web Development. In terms of my coding journey, I am working through the freecodecamp curriculum, completing the Founders and Coders pre-requistes, going to tech meetups weekly and always learning via tech blogs and youtube channels. When I'm not working on my career goals, I enjoy exercising, working on my personal development, volunteering for an animal welfare charity, music, pomodoros and being a student of audiobooks.</p>

            <p>Yes! This is my second Founders and Coders site. My 1st application site is linked in the navigation above. Feel free to take a look.</p>
            <p>What have I been doing since January 2019? I have been busy working through the freeCodeCamp course and learning all about DOM manipulation by completing Wes Bos's JavaScript30 course.</p>
