        <p>I'm Harsheek. Welcome to my surf themed 2nd Founders and Coders application site. Make yourselves at home.</p>

        <h1>Slide Two: Who</h1>
        <p>I am taking action to undergo a career transition. Currently I work as IT project support for a public sector organisation in London and am in the process of transitioning to Web Development. In terms of my coding journey, I am working through the freecodecamp cirriculum, completing the Founders and Coders pre-requistes, going to tech meetups weekly and always learning via tech blogs and youtube channels. When I'm not working on my career goals, I enjoy being active (with calisthenics and swimming), working on my personal development, volunteering for an animal welfare charity, music, pomodoros and being a student of audiobooks.</p>

        <div class="content">
          <h1>Slide Three: 2nd Site?</h1>
            <p>As stated this is my second Founders and Coders site. <a href="https://hthanki.github.io/FAC-application/" target="_blank">Here is my first FAC application site</a> which helped me get a FAC interview, get offered a place but <a href="https://gph.is/2vyW262">the universe had other plans</a> and I was unable to terminate a work contract early to start with the spring 2019 cohort.
            </p>

            <p><strong>So what have I been doing since January 2019?</strong></p>
            <p>I have been busy working through the freeCodeCamp course and learning all about DOM manipulation by completing Wes Bos's <a href="https://javascript30.com/">JavaScript30</a> course. <a href="https://hthanki.github.io/js30/"> Heres all the projects I built with through course.</a></p>
            <p>And of course I've attending tech meetups in London.</p>

              <h1>Slide Four: </h1>
              <p>If that hasn't been keeping me busy enough, I've also been <a href="http://gph.is/2EHo8or" target="_blank">surfing</a> which was always one of my life goals to give it a go. Its been a busy but good year so far!</p>
