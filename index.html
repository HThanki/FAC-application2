                                I am taking action to undergo a career transition. Currently I work as IT project support for a public sector organisation in London and am in the process of transitioning to Web Development. 

                                In terms of my coding journey, I am working through the freecodecamp cirriculum, completing the Founders and Coders pre-requistes, going to tech meetups weekly and always learning via tech blogs and youtube channels. 
                                
                                When I'm not working on my career goals, I enjoy being active (with calisthenics and swimming), working on my personal development, volunteering for an animal welfare charity, music, pomodoros and being a student of audiobooks.
                        </p>

                        As stated this is my second Founders and Coders website. Heres my first site which helped me get an interview with FAC and get offered a place but unfornately due to work contracts I was unable to leave to start with the spring 2019 cohort. 
                    </p>

                    <p>So what have I been doing since January 2019? I've been busy learning about DOM manipulation completing Wes Bos's <a href="https://javascript30.com/">JavaScript30</a> course. <a href="https://hthanki.github.io/js30/"> Heres all the projects I built with through course.</a>

                    CAROUSEL CAROUSEL
                    <p>If that hasn't been keeping me busy enough, I've also been <a href="http://gph.is/2EHo8or" target="_blank">surfing</a> which was always one of my life goals to give it a go. It was pretty awesome.</p>
