        <h2>Aloha!</h2>
        <p>I'm Harsheek. Welcome to my surf themed Founders and Coders application site. Make yourselves at home.</p>

        <h2>Re-introduction</h2>
          <p>I am taking action to undergo a career transition. Currently I'm working as IT project support for a public sector organisation in London and am in the process of transitioning to Web Development. In terms of my coding journey, I am working through the freecodecamp curriculum, completing the Founders and Coders pre-requistes, going to tech meetups weekly and always learning via tech blogs and youtube channels. When I'm not working on my career goals, I enjoy exercising, working on my personal development, volunteering for an animal welfare charity, music, pomodoros and being a student of audiobooks.</p>

          <h2>2nd FAC application site</h2>
            <p>Yes this is my second Founders and Coders site. My 1st application site (submitted for the Spring 2019 cohort) is linked in the navigation above. Feel free to take a look.</p>
            <p>What have I been doing since January 2019? I have been working through the freeCodeCamp course and completed Wes Bos's JavaScript30 course, where I learnt about DOM manipulation.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <h2>Why I am re-applying</h2>
              <p>I want to become a web developer and bring my current skillset to work on teams building products and adding value to people's lives. I love the give back and co-operative ethos of Founders and Coders and would love the opportunity to grow as a web developer with F&C.</p>
              
              <p>There has been so many times in my working life, where I wished I had the tech skills to provide solutions to a problem creatively.</p>
              
              <p>In summary, from my experience working in public sector organisations, current skillset and drive, I would love to continue my coding journey with Founders and Coders to become a professional web developer. I enjoy learning, problem solving, adding value and working with others towards a common goal. I am focussed and ready for the challenge!</p>
